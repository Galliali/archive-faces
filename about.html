    <p class="subtitle">
         A digital repository built from compressed pictures of human faces, conceived as the last remains that may persist within a fully saturated and artificial digital ecosystem. 
         Archive of Faces is one of the methods of 'Post-Archaeology' project, which is proposed as a possible evolution of the archaeology as discipline in response to an archive dominated by the digital and the synthetic.
