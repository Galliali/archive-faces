    <p class="subtitle">
        Archive of Faces constitutes the first methodological practice of the solo exhibition of 'Post-Archaeology' by
        Sara Gallego.
        By creating an online repository, this method focuses on collecting a set of human images that have persisted
        online over time in a highly compressed format.
        These images are understood as digital remains—residual traces that a future civilisation may later use to
        attempt a reconstruction, asking who the person behind the picture was and what story the image might still
        tell. This stage examines the visual erosion of faces produced by image compression, degradation, and
        information loss. Compression is no longer treated as an invisible technical process, but rather as a form of
        material wear within the digital environment—comparable to the effects of time on stone or paper. Digital
        textures, pixel fragmentation, and loss of resolution are read as archaeological traces: signs of a silent
        violence exerted by technology upon human visual memory.
